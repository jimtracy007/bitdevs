    <p>SG BitDevs is inspired by the original BitDevs NYC to help grow a community in Singapore of those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome.
It is engaging and open: each meetup is led by a panel of active Bitcoin contributors, but audience participation is encouraged for a bidirectional exploration of current topics in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
All levels of technical ability and familiarity with Bitcoin are encouraged to come and participate. Weâ€™re here to discuss the state of the network from fundamentals up.
Note: Capturing photos or recording videos is not allowed to ensure a more private and deeper discussion.</p>

<h3 id="socratic-seminars">Socratic Seminars</h3>

<p>Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. After a period of discussion, some events will have presentations of open source
projects, companies, research and other relevant content. A feedback and Q&amp;A
section follow.</p>

<p>A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER
recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin
in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.</p>

<!-- Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic
event or have a recommended topic for discussion: []. There
are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the
project. -->
