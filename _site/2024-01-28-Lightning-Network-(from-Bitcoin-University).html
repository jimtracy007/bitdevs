    <div class="Post-content"><p>Lightning Network is a scaling solution that attempts to address Bitcoin’s slow transaction speeds and high transaction costs.</p>

<p>LN: very fast, very low fees</p>

<p>The native money of the LN is BTC or SATS (1 BTC = 100M SATS)</p>

<p>LN is not controlled by any private company nor its development company - Lightning Labs</p>

<p>LN is an open, permissionless protocol that allows anyone to build on it or send or receive money using it</p>

<p><u>At the start</u>
Christina 100,000 sats =========== Bob 50,000 sats</p>

<p><u>Christina sends Bob 10,000 sats</u>
Christina 90,000 sats =========== Bob 60,000 sats</p>

<p><u>Christina receives from Bob 20,000 sats</u>
Christina 110,000 sats =========== Bob 40,000 sats</p>

<p>To open up a Lightning channel, you and someone else make a 2/2 multi-sig transaction (using the Bitcoin network) that locks up BTC on-chain and then funds that channel with that BTC.</p>

<p>Whatever BTC you add, ends up on your side of the payment channel. Whatever BTC the other person adds, ends up on their side of the payment channel.</p>

<p>No additional BTC is created in the process, so there is no additional monetary inflation.</p>

<p>You can then send money back and forth in that Lightning channel</p>

<p>The LN is made up of 1000s of these two party payment channels.</p>

<p>Christina ===== Bob
Bob ===== John
Christina ===== Bob ===== John</p>

<p>At some point, Christina and Bob may choose to “settle up” by closing their channel by doing a transaction on the Bitcoin base layer. At that point, each person will get the sats that were on their side of the channel</p>

<p>Either person can close the channel whenever they want and claim the sats that rightly belong to them</p>

<p><a href="https://mempool.space/lightning">Lightning Network Map</a></p>

<p>LN transactions are NOT broadcast to the entire network, unlike the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>As a result, no one really knows how many transactions were actually taking place on the LN.</p>

<p>The only channels mapped here are channels that have publicly announced themselves and that are connected to nodes that are connected to mempool.space’s Lightning node.</p>

<p>So there may be many payment channels that we don’t know of.</p>

<p>Payment volume may also be much higher than we think.</p>

<p>Node A and Node B may also be much higher than we think.</p>

<p>Node A and Node B could be sending millions of dollars of Bitcoin back and forth to each other every month and we would never know</p>

<p>Also, Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade ensures that Lightning channel openings and closings look like regular simple spends on-chain.</p>

<p>This contributes to greater privacy.</p>

<h1 id="problem-with-lightning-channels">Problem with Lightning channels</h1>

<p>There is a lot of rebalancing involved with running a channel.</p>

<p>Let’s say that I have a Lightning channel open with my local grocery store (an illustrative example):
I’m usually the one spending the money and sending it to the groccery store when I buy food and I rarely need refunds, so most of the money is flowing one-way. And, most of the money in the channel ends up on their side.</p>

<p>If I want to add more money on my side of the channel, I could try to send more sats to myself if those sats are already on the LN.</p>

<p>But if they are not already on LN – The grocery store and I will need to agree to close our Lightning channel, wait for me to add more sats from on-chain, and then reopen the channel.</p>

<p>That requires two on-chain transactions (closing and then reopening the channel – which can get expensive when Bitcoin transaction fees are high)</p>

<p>And it also means that our channel is down for an hour (6 confirmations) or likely more.</p>

<p>Here’s another problem that needs to be solved:</p>

<p>Unified wallets (Muun, Phoenix, Alby) which allow you transact both on-chain and on LN, while showing you a single total Bitcoin balance</p>

<p>How are these unified wallets supposed to swap back and forth between on-chain BTC and BTC that’s held on the LN.</p>

<p>Alby and Muun solves this problem by holding your BTC onchain then doing a submarine swap when you need to send via LN.</p>

<p>Muun’s model breaks down in a high transaction fee environment as we have seen in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Phoenix utilises splicing, a new technology.</p>

<p>Splicing = the ability to easily add or remove sats from a Lightning channel without having to close and then reopen the channel.</p>

<p>Closing and reopening the channel would require 2 on-chain transaction fees, which can be problematic in a high fee environment.</p>

<p>“Splice in” = add funds to a Lightning channel
“Splice out” = remove funds from a Lightning channel</p>

<p>Splicing makes it much easier to design Bitcoin wallets that can easily send and receive and hold Bitcoin both on-chain and via the LN.</p>

<p>Splicing makes Bitcoin on-chain and Bitcoin on LN more fungible.</p>

<p>That is a huge innovation. For example, you can make an on-chain payment using BTC that is held on the LN and vice versa.</p>

<p>We will do deep dive into the tech of Splicing in the future.</p>
